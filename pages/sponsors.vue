                JupyterCon provides many unique opportunities for sponsors. On the one hand, the conference
                is certainly the best in-person event in the world in which to engage the community that sustains
                and evolves Project Jupyter. Join us and become a participant in that dialogue. One the other
                hand, the conference provides access to a breadth of communities that leverage Project
                Jupyter:
                <ul>
                    <li>as standard tooling for research worldwide</li>
                    <li>widespread use cases throughout education</li>
                    <li>emerging use cases for interactive content in publishing</li>
                    <li>integration points for enterprise data infrastructure, and enterprise concerns:
                        collaboration, compliance, privacy, security, reproducibility, and so on</li>
                    <li>a place to reach practitioners, such as in data science</li>
                </ul>
                JupyterCon as a forum is pro-active on many important shared goals. To paraphrase from the
                <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300">UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>,
                which many organizations have begun to adopt,
                Jupyter plays a growing role in resilient infrastructure (“Build resilient infrastructure, promote
                inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”) and in education (“Ensure
                inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”).
                Moreover, the conference is committed to promoting exemplary practices for diversity and
                inclusion, gender equality, as well as innovating on sustainability practices in conferences. We
                welcome sponsors who can help our community support and demonstrate these practices
                through the event.
